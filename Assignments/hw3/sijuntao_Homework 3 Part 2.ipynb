    "## SI 650 / EECS 549: Homework 3 Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework 3 Part 2 will have you working with deep learning models in a variety of ways. You will likely need to run this on Great Lakes unless you have access to a GPU elsewhere (or be prepared to wait a long time). You should have completed Parts 1 and 2 before attempting this notebook to familiarize yourself with how PyTerrier works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 3, you'll try the following tasks:\n",
    " - Use a large language model to re-rank content\n",
    " - Use a text-to-text model to perform query augmentation\n",
    " - Train a deep learning IR model and compare its performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "The first two of these tasks will rely on models that we've pretrained for you. However, we've also provided code for how to train these. In the third task, you'll do one simple training in evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first two tasks, we've provided most of the code. *You are expected to submit results showing that you have successfully executed it*. You'll need to understand some of the code to complete task 3, which requires you to write new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the past notebooks, you'll need to have `JAVA_HOME` set, which will need to be run on Great Lakes. You can potentially set it in the notebook with a Jupyter command like\n",
    "```\n",
    "!export JAVA_HOME=/fill/in/the/path/to/the/JDK/here\n",
    "```\n",
    "by first figuring out where the JDK is installed. (This is setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in the unix way). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can work on Parts 1 and 2 separately, so feel free to do the GPU-part (Part 2) when the resources are available on Great Lakes and the non-GPU part on your laptop or on a non-GPU Great Lakes machine (which likely will be much faster). Note that there will be no extensions due to Great Lakes bottlenecks, so you are encouraged to complete Part 2 as soon as possible."

      "COVID-19 has become one of the biggest health concern, along with huge economic burden. With no clear remedies to treat the disease, doctors are repurposing drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. In parallel, research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans. Since animal models are critical for vaccine development and SARS-CoV-2 has different transmission dynamics, in this review we compare different animal models of SARS-CoV-2 with humans for their pathogenic, immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for COVID-19. Another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research; thus, we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies.\n"
